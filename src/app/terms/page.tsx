          </p>
          
          <p className="mb-6">
            By registering or using the Platform, you agree to comply with these Terms. If you do not

          <p className="mb-6">
            Nordic Loop is a B2B platform aimed at helping companies give new life to underused or
            surplus materials. We&apos;re a small but ambitious team committed to making circular business
            easy, practical, and profitable.
          </p>
          
          <h2 className="text-xl font-medium mt-8 mb-4">2. Registration</h2>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Browsing listings is open to everyone, but to create, post, or respond to offers on the
            Platform, registration is required.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">During registration, we ask for the following:</p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-6">
            <li>Company name</li>
            <li>Country</li>
            <li>Name and surname</li>

          <h2 className="text-xl font-medium mt-8 mb-4">3. Listings: Offers and Demands</h2>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Users may post material listings, either as an &quot;Offer&quot; (to sell/give away) or &quot;Demand&quot; (to
            acquire).
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">Each listing must:</p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
            <li>Be truthful, clear, and contain sufficient detail</li>
            <li>Not be a duplicate of an existing listing</li>
            <li>Be published for up to 90 days unless renewed</li>
          </ul>
          <p className="mb-6">
            Your company&apos;s contact information is only shared with registered users, not the general
            public.
