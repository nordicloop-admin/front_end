### üé® UI Improvements
- **Responsive layout** with improved mobile support
- **Loading states** for filter dropdowns
- **Better spacing** and organization of filters
- **URL state management** - filters persist on page refresh
- **Debounced search** to reduce API calls

## Technical Implementation

### Frontend Changes
1. **Service Layer** (`services/company.ts`):
   - Added `sector` and `country` parameters to `AdminCompanyParams`
   - Created `getCompanyFilterOptions()` function
   - Added `FilterOption` and `CompanyFilterOptions` interfaces

2. **Component** (`app/admin/companies/page.tsx`):
   - Added state management for new filters
   - Implemented filter option loading
   - Enhanced URL parameter handling
   - Added loading states and error handling

### Backend Changes
1. **Repository** (`company_repository.py`):
   - Enhanced search to include user names via related model
   - Added sector and country filtering
   - Optimized queries with `prefetch_related`

2. **Service** (`company_service.py`):
   - Added new filter parameters

3. **View** (`company_view.py`):
   - Added filter validation
   - Created `CompanyFiltersView` for filter options

4. **URLs** (`company/urls.py`):
   - Added `/api/company/filters/` endpoint

## Usage Examples

### API Endpoints
```bash
# Get filter options
GET /api/company/filters/

# Search with filters
GET /api/company/admin/companies/?search=Test&sector=manufacturing%20%20%26%20Production&country=Sweden&status=approved
```

### Frontend Usage
The filters work automatically when users:
1. Type in the search box (debounced)
2. Select from dropdown filters
3. Navigate with pagination
4. Refresh the page (state persists via URL)

## Performance Considerations
- **Debounced search** (300ms delay) reduces API calls
- **Optimized database queries** with prefetch_related
- **Pagination** maintains performance with large datasets
- **Loading states** provide user feedback
